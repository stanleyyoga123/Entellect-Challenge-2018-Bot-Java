# Go Sample Bot

A naive and hacky version of a bot in Go.

## Go runtime

Find the relevant Go installation files here: https://golang.org/dl/.

To find out more about the Go language, visit the [project website](https://golang.org).

## Running

The game runner will combine compile and execute using the `run` command, rather than as separate steps.  For example:

```
go run golangbot.go
```
